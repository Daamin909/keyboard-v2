# damnboard - a custom keyboard

### 5th June (day 1): brainstorming & schematic

oooo this is gonna be hella fun.
i've already designed a keyboard before this but that one was a bit chunky, with this keyboard, I plan to make it very minimalistic and compact, so it becomes very portable. I also want to print the case in one piece using my own 3D printer which i'm working on right now, it has a build plate of 310mm x 310mm. Meaning I want my keeb to slightly smaller than that. I ended up choosing a 60% layout. I also want to use slide potentiometers and REs for this keyboard.

I designed the layout using kb-layout-editor, and finished the schematic for the switches. I also worked on the aligning the switches.
