# damnboard - a custom keyboard

### 5th June (day 1): brainstorming & schematic

oooo this is gonna be hella fun.
i've already designed a keyboard before this but that one was a bit chunky, with this keyboard, I plan to make it very minimalistic and compact, so it becomes very portable. I also want to print the case in one piece using my own 3D printer which i'm working on right now, it has a build plate of 310mm x 310mm. Meaning I want my keeb to slightly smaller than that. I ended up choosing a 60% layout. I also want to use slide potentiometers and REs for this keyboard.

I designed the layout using kb-layout-editor, and finished the schematic for the switches. I also worked on the aligning the switches.

### 6th June (day 2): finish pcb


after some brainstorming, i decided to not use sliders since they're pretty unfit for what i do. i ended up adding 2 REs and some noepixels on the pcb. since the mcu takes space on the top, ill put some neopixels which will have a glass/acrylic top for aesthetics. i made a VERY cool harry potter themed silkscreen and im very happy with how it turned out. routing this time way way better than my prev keyboard and i actually used a lot less vias. ill work on the case next
