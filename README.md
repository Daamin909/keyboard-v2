## Info

I made this keyboard since I wanted a compact alternative to my bigger keyboard, this keyboard is pretty small in size and has most of the necessary keys. I also wanted to make this one look aesthetically pleasing instead of my old keyboard which did not look really good ðŸ˜­.

It has 9x LEDs, out of which 3 are Red, Blue and Green. I did not use neopixels since PCBA is a bit expensive, and SMD soldering is out of my league for now.

In order to mount the acrylic sheet that is on top of the cutout, I designed a 3D printed part that will be super glued to hold it in place.

I will be using a cool green gradient keycaps, which will blend really well with the white case and the black PCB. The PCB will be visible from the LED cutout. The silkscreen also looks very good and is Harry Potter Themed.

## PCB

The PCB's size is 290.9mm x 123.4mm

The case was made in Fusion360.
The last image is of the 3D printed part to hold the acrylic sheet in place.
I chose to add branding on the bottom case only for aesthetics.

## Total Pricing

The keyboard comes out to be 9,564 INR ($111.96) when adding ordered parts and PCB. Does not include 3D - Printed case, Pico and Knob.
PS:- (Seed Studio costs $142 )
I have chose "air registered mail" over "UPS World Saver" because air registered mail is less likely to get customs even if it is more expensive.

## Notes :-

I want all the five 3D-printed parts to be printed in white color.

Some of the above items, were ordered in packs due to unavailability of singular items.
The pricing might slightly vary due to flash sales, and dollar market trends.
